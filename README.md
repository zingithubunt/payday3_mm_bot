How to make it work:

Important: Bot only works with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 (fullHD) right now!

After saving all the repo files in one directory:

1. Install Python select the "PATH" Option at the installation progress
2. Open cmd on your windows computer and type "pip install opencv-python", "pip install PyAutoGui" and "pip install PySimpleGui"
3. Start the bot.py with python
4. Start PAYDAY3 in fullscreen windowed mode
5. Press F11 in PAYDAY to reduce the size (IMPORTANT: DO NOT MOVE THE WINDOW AFTER PRESSING F11, KEEP IT LIKE IT IS)
6. Use the Bot and feel free to press F11 again, after you found the lobby you were looking for.
